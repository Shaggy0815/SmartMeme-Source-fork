What is SmartMeme?
-----------------
SmartMeme is a unique blockchain platform that combines the power of cryptocurrency with the fun and creativity of memes. It operates on the KAWPOW algorithm, ensuring a robust and efficient Proof of Work mining system. SmartMeme aims to bridge the gap between the crypto community and meme enthusiasts, offering a platform where users can engage, create, and be rewarded. For more detailed information, please refer to the SmartMeme whitepaper available at [SmartMeme Whitepaper](https://www.smartmeme.net/whitepaper).

SmartMeme is dedicated to providing users with the opportunity to earn SmartMeme cryptocurrency while enjoying the world of memes. Our team consists of experienced developers with a deep passion for both crypto and memes, and we are excited to introduce innovative features within our ecosystem. Leveraging the flexibility of blockchain technology, we can utilize creative approaches to bring our vision to life.

In contrast to numerous blockchain projects that lack realistic goals or fail to follow through with their plans, SmartMeme stands apart by delivering a Proof of Concept right from its launch. We believe in demonstrating the feasibility of our ideas and ensuring tangible progress, earning the trust and confidence of our community.

Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/SmartMemeCoin/SmartMeme-Source/tags) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of SmartMeme Core.

The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Testing
-------
SmartMeme Core is dedicated to ensuring all new updates that are released are thoroughly tested before entering the mainnet. This is why we have a testnet running alongside our main chain. While the testnet is running, we will regularly run unit tests built into SmartMeme Core and ensure all reports come back as PASSED.

### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing

Changes should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the
code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful
to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is
not straightforward.
